I make YouTube shorts videos where on top of a minecraft screenshot a text appears
that has a nostalgic message. I want you to create such messages for me. They are usually about
friendship, late nights with the boys, true dreams and good memories (nostalgia stuff)
In recent years talking about this nostalgic era of minecraft became really popular.
I want these videos to show a simple message that has some meaning for all these players that
now have to go through their life. I want the message to put a smile on the viewers face and make him remember all the good things that happened in their worlds. Thier first time playing, first nights, time spent on servers with freinds and the simplicity of minecraft during the 2012 era. The year that made boys fulfill their dreams and years later turned tchem into real, strong and caring men.
This era is very important so the messages should "hit hard in the viewers heart"
The message should be short to fit on screen 
(max for one line is 18 characters) Max 2 lines (can be less if its a simple one liner) 
Try to seperate longer sentences in a way that makes sense for a youtube short
I want you to generate these messages in a pattern like this:

scenery
mood
text here
meybe second line of text

Be sure to include next line after every set. Sets should not include special characters such as
" , . or be indexed in any way (just separate the sets with next line and thats it :D )
I will explain what scenery and mood means
scenery - it can be either Night, Day, House Rain (use Rain one often its pretty good),
or Cave (use Cave not often). 
Pick one that suits the sentence better
mood - it can be either Nostalgic, Sad, Motivation, Happy. Pick one that suits the sentence better
When it comes to mood or scenery use exactly the words I gave you!!!
I need about 20 of such sentences. I also dont want you to write anything before or after the sets.

Here are some great examples of texts:

Building dreams
one block at a time

Built memories
that last

Our worlds live
in memories

New adventures
await us

Empty servers
full of memories

Even in the dark
our dreams shine

Every sunrise
is a new Chance

When the server
falls silent

The nights we
wish could last

Memories linger
in the dark

Good memories
Are priceless

When the trio
Gets together

Time flies by
Memories stay

New adventures
Await the trio

Pov
It's 2012
