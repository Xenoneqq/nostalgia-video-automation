Every block
a new beginning

Even in the dark
our dreams shine

Every sunrise
is a new Chance

Deep in the mines
with old friends

Late nights
never forgotten

When the server
falls silent

Sleepy eyes
and bright ideas

When the server
falls silent

The nights we
wish could last

Memories linger
in the dark

Good memories
Are priceless

When the trio
Gets together

Old friends
Old worlds

Time flies by
Memories stay

New adventures
Await the trio

Pov
It's 2012 again

Pov
Hunt for Herobrine

Deep in the mines
with old friends

Remember being
Stuck Here?

Time flies by
Memories Stay

Hunting For
Herobrine

Pov
It's 2012

Crafting dreams
Block by block

Empty servers
full of memories

Before beds
Night was Real

Home is where
our hearts are

Adventure starts
with One Block

Crafted memories
never fade

It's time
2-week Phas

Treasures found
memories kept

Bright days
forge bright futures

Every block
a Memory

From humble homes
to endless horizons

Every sunrise
is a new Chance

Deep in the mines
with old friends

New Day
New Opportunity

After a Dark Night
Bright morning awaits
